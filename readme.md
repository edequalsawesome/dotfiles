# eD!'s Super-Fancy Dotfile Configuration of Awesomeness and Humility

Behold, my `dotfiles`, because keeping them in iCloud was stupid and keeping them here is easier. Ta-da.

## What's In Here

- **ZSH config** with Oh My Zsh and Spaceship theme
- **Ghostty terminal** config with decent padding so text doesn't assault my eyeballs, and fonts, and all sorts of other color/font tweaks
- **Setup script** that does all the boring stuff automatically, ya boi ain't got time for manual setups (there's dogs to be snuggled, after all)

## Quick Start

Fresh machine? Run this and have a li'l treat while you wait, you deserve it

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edequalsawesome/dotfiles/main/setup.sh | bash
